# Udacity-Machine-Learning-Capstone

**Stock Prediction using AWS SageMaker DeepAR Algorithm**

This is my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project. In this project, I use the DeepAR RNN algorithm via AWS SageMaker to try to predict adjust close stock prices in the near future using historical pricing data.

Files/Folders:
Project Report: Where the overall project report can be found.
Farrell ML Capstone Stock Predictor - Single Stock HPM: Python notebok to execute the data wrangling, preprocessing, training/fitting, and further analysis.
stock_time_series.py: Helper functions for Python notebooks
Alternate Models: Additional Python notebooks that were used for alternative analyses
json_stock_data: local directory for extracted adjusted close price data for a stock; saved in JSON file format
